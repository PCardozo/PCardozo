Hello World! 👋

I'm Pablo, and welcome to my github Profile.

🤓 I'm somewhat new to the tech industry, adn I'm currently looking to land my first job as a Programmer.

🕹 I've studied Game Design and development in the past, and got familiar with the programming world. I didn't take that seriously at the time, but now, I'm very serious about becoming a PROgrammer.

🛠 I've had jobs of all kinds in the past, but if there is one thing they mostly had in common, was the use of PCs or digital tools. And that makes all the sense in the world, because I learnt (and got to love) all the things a computer can do at a very early age. 6 years old, to be precise.

❗ Another important thing I've gotta mention: I'm a self-taught english speaker (my native language is spanish). I learnt the language out of the need of understanding what was going on when I played videogames (I used to play a lot of RPGs back then, so, reading english was a must). And as time progressed, I became better at listening, understanding and speaking the language, to the point I finally became fluent. This skill landed me a job at a small company in Buenos Aires, where I had to teach agents from Universities across all the US on the usage of an intern platform we used to keep track of leads (all of this was done live, via zoom, and of course, in english). 

💻 Now I've just finished one of the most intense bootcamps I've ever got to know, SOY HENRY, where I've acquired the tools and the knowledge needed to be part of a web development team. Some of the technologies I've learnt at this bootcamp are: Javascript, React, Node, Express, Postgresql, Git,  among many others.

I hope you had a good time reading my bio, and if you need to, don't hesitate on reaching out!
